IELTS Writing - Prison Is the Best Punishment
IELTS, English Writing
<p>Prison is the best punishment for criminals. Discuss.</p>

<p>Laws are instituted at least in part to help order society so that its organisations, institutions and citizenry can work together harmoniously. If one is convicted a crime against the law, some kind of punishment will ensue. A natural question raised in this line of thought is that what the best punishment for criminals is. Some hold strongly that prison is the solution. On the other hand, others disagree with their view arguing that the existence of a universally optimal solution is questionable. Personally, I believe that sending criminals to prison is not necessarily the best solution.</p>

<p>Some people who are in favour of the position that prison is the best punishment for criminals argue that the deprivation of one's freedom is the ultimate punishment for criminals, and thus sending people to prison sends a strong and affirmative message to would-be criminals and at the same time helps to rehabilitate people who have already committed crimes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, others strongly object the view above on the grounds that the reasoning in the argument above is fundamentally fallacious. It if true that prison is arguably the best punishment for some criminals, but it is never the best punishment for all criminals. For example, minor offences should be more properly punished with less severe punishment.</p>

<p>Moreover, some critics also point out that ironically prison sometimes encourage crime rather than preventing it. They observe that prison effectively provides shelter an food to its inmates. Although most people would not trade freedom with shelter and food, some would, especially those live in poverty.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I hold that prison is not the best punishment of all criminals. The burden of proof for such a bold claim is enormous, and such a claim can be easily attached by showing that there is another form of punishment which is better than prison for at least one kind of criminals.</p>
