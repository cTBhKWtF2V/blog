Most people, especially those living in crowed big cities, resent travelling to work during the rush hours on weekdays, which typically takes them a hour or so. The time saved from daily commuting can then be spent with families. In addition, for people who has a baby, working at home also means a considerable saving on baby-sitting. the benefit would also apply to those who have elderly people to look after at home. In general , allowing people to work at home maximises the flexibility in their timetable, and significantly reduce the encroachment of work upon their personal life.</p>

<p>On the other side of the coin, working at home also carries some concerns. At the comfort of their own home, people can easily get distracted by their families, television and the Internet. In contrast, people are typically more productive and focused in an office due to the constant supervision from colleagues and managers. Furthermore, working at home making it hard to communicate with other colleagues, even with the latest technologies. If all the employees are co-located, they enjoy the convenience of exchanging ideas face-to-face. Working at home adds an extra layer of difficulty to communication.</p>

But for other occupations, the disadvantages may be more significant. Whether working at home is advisable depends largely on the nature of one's job.</p>
