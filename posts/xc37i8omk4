IELTS Writing - Same number of male and female students IELTS 5 Test 1
IELTS, English Writing
<p>Universities should accept equal number of male and female students in every subject. </p>
<p>To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>

<p>The issue as to whether universities should accept equal number of male and female students in every subject engendered controversy. Some people hold that universities should do so because it would otherwise perpetuate sex inequality. However, other people believe that universities should allow varying number of male and female students in some subjects to acknowledge the fundamental differences between male and female. Personally, I think it is necessary for universities to have different number of male and female students enrolled in some subjects.</p>

<p>Some hold strongly that universities should accept the same number of students from other genders and failure to do so places a potential menace to gender inequality, which goes against the very basic principles of human rights. There are a preponderance of male managers in some professions. If universities are allowed to accept more male students than females, male will become more socially and economically powerful.</p>

<p>However, I think the view above overlooks the fundamental differences between two biological sexes. there are remarkable differences between the male and female bodies and perhaps the brain structures of the two are not exactly identical. We need to acknowledge this biological difference and thereby acknowledge the fact that some professions are better undertaken by males and some others by females. As a result, it is completely natural that universities should allow different number of male and females students to enrol in some subjects.</p>

<p>In addition, male and female generally do not have the same level of interest in all university subjects and thus the number of applicants from both sexes are generally different, which would eventually lead to a difference in the number of male and female students enrolled.</p>

<p>To conclude, given the aforementioned reasons, I think allowing different number of male and female students in some subjects recognises the biological differences between the two and allows each gender to maximise their own potentials.</p>
