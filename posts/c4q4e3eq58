IELTS, English Writing
<p>When a country develop its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep then alive.</p>

<p>To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?</p>

<p>With the advancement in technology, many traditional skills have become obsolete. Technological innovations have brought fundamental shifts to the ways of life. Some people advocate that both the traditional skills and the old ways of life should be preserved at all cost, while others believe that the society should not carry the burden of something outdated and it is pointless to keep them alive. I believe that there is no universal answer to this question, and we need to look at the intrinsic nature of a specific skill or way of life.</p>

<p>Some traditional skills and lifestyles, although outdated, were produced by a certain period of human history, and thus carry the memory of mankind or even define a certain culture. They belong to the posterity and thus must be preserved. For example, Chinese dumplings can now be manufactured on a large scale, however, the skill of making hand-made dumplings should be nevertheless preserved, because that specific makes a Chinese Chinese. Another example lies in the way people communicate. Although emails are much faster and more efficient, sending physical Christmas cards should not be replaced by cold emails.</p>

<p>On the other hand, people also have to acknowledge that the society is experiencing radical changes everyday in every possible way. Carrying all the traditional skills and ways of life will potentially deter the social advancement, and therefore we need to let a few of them die out, which i also a natural implication of social development. For example, people do no dress like what they did decades ago and do not ride a horse as a serious means for commuting.</p>

<p>To conclude, people need to try and keep some of the traditional skills and ways of life alive, especially those that carry traditional and cultural values, at the same time, allow the others to die out naturally.</p>
