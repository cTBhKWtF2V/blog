IELTS, English Writing
<p>Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.</p>

<p>To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?</p>

<p>Some critics believe that international sporting occasions like the Olympic Games and football World Cup are puppets whose strings are pulled by politicians behind the curtain to ease international tensions or to let out domestic patriotic emotions in a safe way. Although it may sound cynical, I personally believe international sporting occasions are one of the tools used by politicians to manipulate international relations.</p>

<p>Some people may argue that international sporting occasions cannot achieve that effect because they do not resolve the issues that engendered international tensions. Secondly, not all people are interested in sports and it is unwarranted to assume all patriotic people are all sport fans.</p>

<p>I think the arguments above are vulnerable to criticism. First, although it is true that international sporting events do not resolve the fundamental issues, they help to ease the tensions between national and perhaps bring them back to negotiation. Secondly, it is also true that not everyone is a sport fan, however, sports have the magic to stir everyone's blood if he is not living in a social vacuum. Most people, if not all,  are mentally wired to defend their own nation and get excited in a sport event.</p>

<p>Historical evidences lend credence to the fact that sporting events help to ease international tensions. For instance, when the People's Republic of China has just been founded, the USA strategically used Ping Pong game to build a healthy relationship with China. Moreover, during the Olympic Games, all nations will cease war. Such sporting events remind people that the human race should be united and warfare should be avoided by all means.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, I think international sporting games are essential in easing international tensions and release patriotic emotions in a safe way.</p>
