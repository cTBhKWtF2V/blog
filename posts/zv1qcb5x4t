<p>Recent technological innovations bring out an ever-increasing number of media for communicating information. In this short essay, I will first compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of three different media, namely books, television and radio, and point out the reasons why I think television is the most effective media. </p>

<p>Historically, books had been a predominant media for communication before the advent of the other two media. Information carried by books is typically very accurate, well-thought and well-elaborated. Books are the best vehicle for a number of kinds of information, for example, statutes and scientific finding. On the flip side of the coin, however, books, as a media for communicating information, have two intrinsic drawbacks. First of all, only educated people can consume information carried by books, and a large number of people, especially those in developing countries, due to historical or personal reasons, cannot read. Secondly, reading a book is commonly deemed as time-consuming compared to the other two media. </p>

<p>The most remarkable advantage of radio is that it enables people to multitask and does not require people to sit at one place when consuming information. People can listen to radio while driving or jogging around the blocks. It is an appealing merit to people who do not enjoy a sedentary lifestyle. But radio does not provide a visual representation of information. Psychologically, it is generally hard for people to remember non-visual information. </p>

<p>Television has become a nest and a major entertainment nowadays. With vivid sound and visual effects, television programs never fail to catch people's attention. Most people enjoy television more than the other two media because it provides a multimedia experience and thereby is considered as a combination of the other two. On the other hand, however, the prevalence of television has posed a worrying risk on people's general well-being. Many people sit in front of a television for hours every day, which is generally considered unhealthy. </p>

<p>Among these three media, I think television is the most effective. It is express and always up-to-date. Most importantly, I believe it has the largest audience and therefore is the most effective way to get messages across to the general public. </p>
