					<p>Today is the Chinese New Year. Although this question has never occurred to me, a native Chinese, the correct translation of the zodiac for this year puzzled most culture ambassadors and translators, is this year the year of sheep or the year of goat. Few native Chinese would have questioned that as we have a noun for that species whereas there is a lack of such am equivalence in other languages. Sheep does not sound more correct than Goat and vice versa. </p>

<p>Google obviously thinks that this year must be a year of goat (https://www.google.com.au/?doodle=19145581&hl=en&gws_rd=ssl&nord=1). However, I would quickly conjure up a picture of a sheep when I hear that zodiac in Chinese. Perhaps this is because I was born and raised in Beijing and sheep is more common in the Northern part of China and people from the South would probably have a very different picture. </p>

<p>Obviously, there are intrinsic and inevitable difficulties in bringing one concept from one culture to another and clearly there is much work that needs to be done to make Chinese culture to be able to tell compelling stories, influence others to fall in love with it. Nevertheless, what I see is that there is culture exchange on many levels and the West is making so much effort in understanding Chinese culture, replacing what was once ignorance, fear and hatred with acceptance, friendship and even love. Although Chinese is not the second largest race in Australia, I believe its culture, though still not mainstream, is more influential than those of other minority race groups.</p>

<p>Although this may sound like harsh reality, I believe that the West's sudden interest in Chinese culture stems largely from the fact that China is arising to be a global power, and possibly the next super power. It is economically beneficial to break the walls between the West and China and build relationships.</p>
