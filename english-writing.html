					<p>Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.</p>

<p>To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?</p>

<p>Some critics believe that international sporting occasions like the Olympic Games and football World Cup are puppets whose strings are pulled by politicians behind the curtain to ease international tensions or to let out domestic patriotic emotions in a safe way. Although it may sound cynical, I personally believe international sporting occasions are one of the tools used by politicians to manipulate international relations.</p>

<p>Some people may argue that international sporting occasions cannot achieve that effect because they do not resolve the issues that engendered international tensions. Secondly, not all people are interested in sports and it is unwarranted to assume all patriotic people are all sport fans.</p>

<p>I think the arguments above are vulnerable to criticism. First, although it is true that international sporting events do not resolve the fundamental issues, they help to ease the tensions between national and perhaps bring them back to negotiation. Secondly, it is also true that not everyone is a sport fan, however, sports have the magic to stir everyone's blood if he is not living in a social vacuum. Most people, if not all,  are mentally wired to defend their own nation and get excited in a sport event.</p>

<p>Historical evidences lend credence to the fact that sporting events help to ease international tensions. For instance, when the People's Republic of China has just been founded, the USA strategically used Ping Pong game to build a healthy relationship with China. Moreover, during the Olympic Games, all nations will cease war. Such sporting events remind people that the human race should be united and warfare should be avoided by all means.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, I think international sporting games are essential in easing international tensions and release patriotic emotions in a safe way.</p>

					<h1>IELTS Writing - Traditional skills die out IELTS 3 Test 2

					<p>When a country develop its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep then alive.</p>

<p>To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?</p>

<p>With the advancement in technology, many traditional skills have become obsolete. Technological innovations have brought fundamental shifts to the ways of life. Some people advocate that both the traditional skills and the old ways of life should be preserved at all cost, while others believe that the society should not carry the burden of something outdated and it is pointless to keep them alive. I believe that there is no universal answer to this question, and we need to look at the intrinsic nature of a specific skill or way of life.</p>

<p>Some traditional skills and lifestyles, although outdated, were produced by a certain period of human history, and thus carry the memory of mankind or even define a certain culture. They belong to the posterity and thus must be preserved. For example, Chinese dumplings can now be manufactured on a large scale, however, the skill of making hand-made dumplings should be nevertheless preserved, because that specific makes a Chinese Chinese. Another example lies in the way people communicate. Although emails are much faster and more efficient, sending physical Christmas cards should not be replaced by cold emails.</p>

<p>On the other hand, people also have to acknowledge that the society is experiencing radical changes everyday in every possible way. Carrying all the traditional skills and ways of life will potentially deter the social advancement, and therefore we need to let a few of them die out, which i also a natural implication of social development. For example, people do no dress like what they did decades ago and do not ride a horse as a serious means for commuting.</p>

<p>To conclude, people need to try and keep some of the traditional skills and ways of life alive, especially those that carry traditional and cultural values, at the same time, allow the others to die out naturally.</p>

					<p>The line graph depicts the past and projected proportion of population aged 65 and over for a 100 years time span from 1940 to 2040 in three countries, namely Japan, Sweden and the USA.</p>

<p>The most distinguishing feature is that there is an upward trend in the proportion of the senior in all three countries over this period of time. Another interesting observation is that Japan had the lowest proportion of population over 65 and over among the three, but is projected to have the highest property by 2040.</p>

<p>Looking at the details, the proportion of the senior in the USA grows steadily over this period of time, with only a marginal drop between 1980 and 2010. As regards Sweden, the proportion started at approximately 7.5% in 1940 and is estimated to rise to just above 25% in 2040 with fluctuations along the way.</p>

<p>In constrast, the proportion of the senior people in Japan dropped slightly from 5% in 1940 to around 3% in 1960 and then remained constant until around 1990. The figure then rose with an increasing speed and is projected to skyrocket from 10% in 2020 to 25% in 2040, outstripping the senior proportion in the other two countries.</p>

					<p>Universities should accept equal number of male and female students in every subject. </p>
<p>To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>

<p>The issue as to whether universities should accept equal number of male and female students in every subject engendered controversy. Some people hold that universities should do so because it would otherwise perpetuate sex inequality. However, other people believe that universities should allow varying number of male and female students in some subjects to acknowledge the fundamental differences between male and female. Personally, I think it is necessary for universities to have different number of male and female students enrolled in some subjects.</p>

<p>Some hold strongly that universities should accept the same number of students from other genders and failure to do so places a potential menace to gender inequality, which goes against the very basic principles of human rights. There are a preponderance of male managers in some professions. If universities are allowed to accept more male students than females, male will become more socially and economically powerful.</p>

<p>However, I think the view above overlooks the fundamental differences between two biological sexes. there are remarkable differences between the male and female bodies and perhaps the brain structures of the two are not exactly identical. We need to acknowledge this biological difference and thereby acknowledge the fact that some professions are better undertaken by males and some others by females. As a result, it is completely natural that universities should allow different number of male and females students to enrol in some subjects.</p>

<p>In addition, male and female generally do not have the same level of interest in all university subjects and thus the number of applicants from both sexes are generally different, which would eventually lead to a difference in the number of male and female students enrolled.</p>

<p>To conclude, given the aforementioned reasons, I think allowing different number of male and female students in some subjects recognises the biological differences between the two and allows each gender to maximise their own potentials.</p>

					<h1>IELTS Writing - Working at home

					</h5>
					<p>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working at home

<p>The prevalence of the Internet and other modern communication technologies makes it feasible for people to work at home, especially for those who perform computer-related work. This short essay will discuss the pros and cons of working at home.</p>

<p>Working at home yields bountiful benefits, the most important of which is that people can avoid commuting to work on a daily basis and thereby reduce their carbon footprint and save time. Most people, especially those living in crowed big cities, resent travelling to work during the rush hours on weekdays, which typically takes them a hour or so. The time saved from daily commuting can then be spent with families. In addition, for people who has a baby, working at home also means a considerable saving on baby-sitting. the benefit would also apply to those who have elderly people to look after at home. In general , allowing people to work at home maximises the flexibility in their timetable, and significantly reduce the encroachment of work upon their personal life.</p>

<p>On the other side of the coin, working at home also carries some concerns. At the comfort of their own home, people can easily get distracted by their families, television and the Internet. In contrast, people are typically more productive and focused in an office due to the constant supervision from colleagues and managers. Furthermore, working at home making it hard to communicate with other colleagues, even with the latest technologies. If all the employees are co-located, they enjoy the convenience of exchanging ideas face-to-face. Working at home adds an extra layer of difficulty to communication.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, working at home has both advantages and disadvantages. For some occupations in which people tend to work more independently, the advantages of working at home outweighs its disadvantages. But for other occupations, the disadvantages may be more significant. Whether working at home is advisable depends largely on the nature of one's job.</p>

					<p>The bar chart and pie chart above show the most popular films by genre for men and women and general ticket sales for different types of films in the USA in 2010. The genres surveyed included action, comedy, thriller among a few others.</p>

<p>Overall, there is a significant difference in the most popular film genres for men and women. In addition, the popularity of each film genre differs drastically in the USA in 2010, as shown by the pie chart.</p>

<p>The bar chart suggests that the most popular type of film for men was action, whereas it was the second popular for women. The most interesting observation is that 30% of women enjoyed romantic comedy, making it the most popular genre for women. In contrast, romantic comedy was the least popular genre for men, with a mere 5% of men choosing it. The same proportion of men and women choose comedy and western as their favourite. Thriller and science fiction films are remarkably more popular among men. Only two-third as many women chose thriller as men, and this figure dropped to a half for science fiction.</p>

<p>The bar chart reveals that action is predominantly the most popular genre in 2010, accounting for almost half of the entire box-office takings. Comedy came the second at 24%, which is followed by romantic comedy at 12%. Forth on the list was thriller at 10% and the remaining 5% was shared by all other genres.</p>

					<h1>IELTS Writing - Media for communicating information
</h1>
					<h5>

					</h5>
					<p>Compare the advantages and disadvantages of three of the following as media for communicating information. State which you consider to be the most effective.</p>
<p>
comics,
books,
radio,
television,
film,
threatre
</p>
<p>Recent technological innovations bring out an ever-increasing number of media for communicating information. In this short essay, I will first compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of three different media, namely books, television and radio, and point out the reasons why I think television is the most effective media. </p>

<p>Historically, books had been a predominant media for communication before the advent of the other two media. Information carried by books is typically very accurate, well-thought and well-elaborated. Books are the best vehicle for a number of kinds of information, for example, statutes and scientific finding. On the flip side of the coin, however, books, as a media for communicating information, have two intrinsic drawbacks. First of all, only educated people can consume information carried by books, and a large number of people, especially those in developing countries, due to historical or personal reasons, cannot read. Secondly, reading a book is commonly deemed as time-consuming compared to the other two media. </p>

<p>The most remarkable advantage of radio is that it enables people to multitask and does not require people to sit at one place when consuming information. People can listen to radio while driving or jogging around the blocks. It is an appealing merit to people who do not enjoy a sedentary lifestyle. But radio does not provide a visual representation of information. Psychologically, it is generally hard for people to remember non-visual information. </p>

<p>Television has become a nest and a major entertainment nowadays. With vivid sound and visual effects, television programs never fail to catch people's attention. Most people enjoy television more than the other two media because it provides a multimedia experience and thereby is considered as a combination of the other two. On the other hand, however, the prevalence of television has posed a worrying risk on people's general well-being. Many people sit in front of a television for hours every day, which is generally considered unhealthy. </p>

<p>Among these three media, I think television is the most effective. It is express and always up-to-date. Most importantly, I believe it has the largest audience and therefore is the most effective way to get messages across to the general public. </p>

					<h1>IELTS Writing - Prison Is the Best Punishment
</h1>
					<h5>
					
					<a href="ielts.html">ielts</a> 
					
					<a href="english-writing.html">english-writing</a> 
					
					</h5>
					<p>Prison is the best punishment for criminals. Discuss.</p>

<p>Laws are instituted at least in part to help order society so that its organisations, institutions and citizenry can work together harmoniously. If one is convicted a crime against the law, some kind of punishment will ensue. A natural question raised in this line of thought is that what the best punishment for criminals is. Some hold strongly that prison is the solution. On the other hand, others disagree with their view arguing that the existence of a universally optimal solution is questionable. Personally, I believe that sending criminals to prison is not necessarily the best solution.</p>

<p>Some people who are in favour of the position that prison is the best punishment for criminals argue that the deprivation of one's freedom is the ultimate punishment for criminals, and thus sending people to prison sends a strong and affirmative message to would-be criminals and at the same time helps to rehabilitate people who have already committed crimes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, others strongly object the view above on the grounds that the reasoning in the argument above is fundamentally fallacious. It if true that prison is arguably the best punishment for some criminals, but it is never the best punishment for all criminals. For example, minor offences should be more properly punished with less severe punishment.</p>

<p>Moreover, some critics also point out that ironically prison sometimes encourage crime rather than preventing it. They observe that prison effectively provides shelter an food to its inmates. Although most people would not trade freedom with shelter and food, some would, especially those live in poverty.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I hold that prison is not the best punishment of all criminals. The burden of proof for such a bold claim is enormous, and such a claim can be easily attached by showing that there is another form of punishment which is better than prison for at least one kind of criminals.</p>
