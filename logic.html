					<p>Here is a collection of the common logical fallacies</p>

<p>1. Ad Hominem: Attacking a person or their character rather than making a claim based on reasoning. </p>

<p>2. Adedote: Using a personal or isolated experience as compelling and worthwhile evidence; suggesting that a personal or unique experience can be applied to other circumstances</p>

<p>3. Appeal to Ignorance: Using human ignorance or the inability to prove something in order make a claim.</p>

<p>4. Appeal to Tradition: Using tradition or cultural belief to suggest that something is true or accurate; suggesting that, because something has long been done in a certain way, it must be the correct way.</p>

<p>5. Appeal to Consequences: Concluding that a premise is either true or false base on what the consequence of that premise would be.</p>

<p>6. Argumentum ad Baculum: Making an argument by inciting fear or making threat.</p>

<p>7. Argumentum ad Ignorantiam: Relying a person's or group of people's ignorance to make a claim; misleading a person or group by appealing to their lack of knowledge in a particular topic. </p>

<p>8. Argumentum ad Populum: Attempting to sway popular support by appealing to sentimental weakness rather than with facts to reason.</p>

<p>9. Badwagon: Claiming something to be true or accurate simply because most people believe it to be true or accurate.</p>

<p>10. Begging the question: Making a claim that uses a tacit or implied assumption; raises a question by assuming an answer or shared belief. </p>

<p>11. Black or White: Suggesting only two alternate conclusions exist when, in reality, several possibilities exist. </p>

<p>12. Cherry-pick: Cherry-picking a particular data set or collection of facts while ignoring others in order to make an argument that suits a particular purpose. </p>

<p>13. Circular Reasoning: Using evidence that hasn't been proven in order to prove something else, then using that something else to prove the original claim. </p>

<p>14. Composition: Making erroneous conclusions about the composition of a whole or part of something. </p>

<p>15. Confirmation Bias: Making an argument that relies heavily on a personal bias.</p>

<p>16. Confusion of Correlation and Causation: Making claims about the cause of something simply because there exists a correlation between two things.</p>

<p>17. Exclude Middle: Considering only the extremes in any argument and ignoring the possibilities that exist in between. </p>

<p>18. Half Truth: Intentionally misleading a person to believe something by telling something that is, in fact, true, but leaving out important information. </p>

<p>19. Loaded Question: Asking a question that, if answered, will imply a shared agreement. </p>

<p>20. Misunderstanding Statistics: Making strange or erroneous claims about a particular idea by using statistics that have little or no ability to make such a claim. </p>

<p>21. Non Sequitur: "It does not follow". Making a conclusion that does not follow from previously established premises or conclusions.</p>

<p>22. Omniscience: Using non-qualified statement to suggest ideas that imply "all" or "every" thing or situation.</p>

<p>23. Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc: "It happened after, so it was caused by." Suggesting that, because something previously happened that is related to an event, the previous happening caused the new event.</p>

<p>24. Proving Non-existence: Instead of proving something to exist or be true, an arguer asks his/her opponent to prove that it doesn't exist. </p>

<p>25. Red Herring: Diverting attention by changing the subject. </p>

<p>26. Reification: Treating abstract or hypothetical things or ideas as concrete realities.</p>

<p>27. Slippery Slope: Arguing that a change in procedure, law, or action will create a domino-effect of adverse consequences, suggesting if one thing happens, a series of things will inevitably happen. </p>

<p>28. Small Number Statistics: Using an instance of a small fraction of the population to make an argument for the greater population. </p>

<p>29. Straw Man: Concocting a false or made up scenario and then attacking that scenario in order to make an opponent look bad. </p>

<p>30. Tu Quoque: Avoiding engagement with another's arugment by arguing something unrelated in return. </p>
